## GHG Tracker Project

The GHG Tracker Project provides comprehensive data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate targets, focusing on both national and subnational actors (e.g., states, provinces, and cities). The project harmonizes emissions data and target information into a common framework. Its goal is to create a comprehensive, open-source database that serves as a reliable resource for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders.

GHG Tracker collects and organizes data on emissions by sector and gas wherever possible. It also integrates national and subnational emission reduction pledges. In addition, the database includes contextual information such as population, GDP, and energy consumption, providing a more complete picture of the drivers behind emissions changes through frameworks like the Kaya identity.

GHG Tracker Database is written entirely in Python to facilitate easier collaboration, maintainability, and integration with the broader data science ecosystem. The first phase of the project is building out the database. The next phase will be a high-level API that makes it easy to query the database.
